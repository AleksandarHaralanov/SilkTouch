# GradlePluginTemplate
A template project to use as a base for Poseidon (b1.7.3) plugin development. It comes with a test module that will automatically copy your build output to the test servers plugins folder, then boot it up.

# Usage
It's recommended to use IntelliJ. You should be able to clone with VCS directly when creating a project, and if everything goes right, the Gradle project should also be automatically imported.
